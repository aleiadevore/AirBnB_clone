# AirBnB_clone :house_with_garden:

![HBnB](HBNB_image.png)
### Introduction:
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnb clone. We must begin by writing a command interpreter to manage all the objects for AirBnb! We must also build a storage engine, with which the interpreter will interact. 
## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:
Clone AirBnB_clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleiadevore/AirBnB_clone.git
```

There are **two** ways in which the interpreter can be run:   
  _Interactive_ and _Non-Interactive modes._:  



### Interactive Mode:
> ```bash
> ./console.py
> (hbnb) <command>
> ```
### Non-Interactive Mode:
> ```bash
> echo "<command>" | ./console.py
>```
## Usage :woman_technologist:
The console accepts the following _commands_:  
  
> **create**  
**show**  
**destroy**  
**all**  
**update**

 
|Command|Description|Ex:|     
|----|-----|-------|     
|**create**|creates a new instance then prints it's _id_.|**create City**|
|**show**|shows instance based on _class name_ and _id_. |**show User 4555-4655-54585**|
|**destroy**|destroys an instance based on _class name_ and _id_. |**destroy Amenity**|
|**all**|prints all instances based or not on the _class name_|**all City**|
|| |**all**|
